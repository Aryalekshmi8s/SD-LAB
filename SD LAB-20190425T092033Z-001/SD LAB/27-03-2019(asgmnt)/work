Ques 1. Write a shell program to pass two number arguments in command line and
check whether these numbers are equal or less than or greater than. (use if)

echo -e "enter two numbers : \c"
read a b
if [ $a -eq $b ]
then
echo " $a and $b are equal"
elif [ $a -gt $b ]
then
echo "$a is greater"
elif [ $a -lt $b ]
then
echo "$a is less than $b"
else
echo "no matches.."
fi

code:

student@T13:~$ chmod +x first.sh
student@T13:~$ ./first.sh
enter two numbers : 1 1
1 and 1 are equal
student@T13:~$ ./first.sh
enter two numbers : 1 2
1 is less than 2
student@T13:~$ ./first.sh
enter two numbers : 6 2
6 is greater

Ques 2. Write a shell program to read a number given by user and check whether the
number is even or odd or zero. (use if)

echo -e "enter a number : \c "
read a
r=$(($a %2 ))
if [ $a -eq 0 ]
then
echo "$a is 0" 
elif [ $r -eq 0 ]
then
echo "$a is  even"
else
echo "$a is odd"
fi


code

student@T13:~$ chmod +x two.sh
student@T13:~$ ./two.sh
enter a number : 6
6 is  even
student@T13:~$ ./two.sh
enter a number : 1
1 is odd
student@T13:~$ ./two.sh
enter a number : 0
0 is  0

Ques 3. Write a shell program to read a year from user and check whether the year is
leap or not. (use if)

echo -e "enter a year "
read yr
   if [ $(( yr % 4)) -eq 0 ] 
   then
     if [ $(( yr % 100)) -eq 0 ]
       then 
         if [ $(( yr % 400)) -eq 0 ]
            then
            echo "$yr is leap year"
         else
            echo "$yr is not leap year"
         fi
     else
           echo "$yr is leap year"
      fi
   else
     echo "$yr is not leap year"
   fi

code

student@T13:~$ ./three.sh
enter a year 
2020
2020 is leap year
student@T13:~$ ./three.sh
enter a year 
1900
1900 is not leap year
student@T13:~$ ./three.sh
enter a year 
1800
1800 is not leap year


Ques 4. Write a shell program to read a character from user and check whether it is
consonant or vowel or not an alphabet. (use if)

echo -e "enter a character"
read x
y='[a-z A-Z]'
if [[ "$x" =~ $y ]]
 then
 if [[ "$x" == *[AEIOUaeiou]* ]]
then
 echo "$x is vowel"
 else
 echo "$x is consonent"
 fi
 else
 echo "not an alphabet"
fi


code

student@T13:~$ ./four.sh
enter a character
A
A is vowel
student@T13:~$ ./four.sh
enter a character
O
O is vowel
student@T13:~$ ./four.sh
enter a character
y
y is consonent
student@T13:~$ ./four.sh
enter a character
0
not an alphabet
student@T13:~$ ./four.sh
enter a character
}
not an alphabet



Ques 5. Write a shell program to print all natural numbers in reverse from 1 to n. (read
the value of ‘n’ from user) (use for)

echo -e "enter a limit: \c "
read n
for (( i=n; i>=1; i--))
do
echo "$i"
done

code

student@T13:~$ ./five.sh
enter a limit: 6
6
5
4
3
2
1


Ques 6. Write a shell program to print multiplication table of a number. (read the value
of ‘n’ from user) (use for)


echo -e "Enter a number:\c"
read n
echo "Multiplication Table of $n"
for i in {1..10}
do
  p=$(($i * $n))
  echo "$i * $n = $p"
done

student@T13:~$ ./six.sh
Enter a number:3
Multiplication Table of 3
1 * 3 = 3
2 * 3 = 6
3 * 3 = 9
4 * 3 = 12
5 * 3 = 15
6 * 3 = 18
7 * 3 = 21
8 * 3 = 24
9 * 3 = 27
10 * 3 = 30
